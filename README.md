some history: main was first branched into NewDev, then both
NewDev and main were changed to create conflict. Then, another
branch was created off of NewDev (SubDev) which had sub-branch-
specific information. Then NewDev was merged into main*, the
conflict was resolved BUT SubDev cannot really be accessed via
GitKraken as NewDev could be before, it's still a "sub-branch",
so I can only edit SubDev-spec info here, on github. But it does
give me the option to merge SubDev into main or even into NewDev
which has since been merged into main...

*SubDev was not merged into NewDev prior to this (on purpose)
