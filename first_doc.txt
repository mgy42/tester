First line
(create a new branch, add a document to that)

Second line
(edit first_doc in both branches to create conflict)

Third line

Added this one through github, to have something to pull
Added a line underneath this to remind me: the local folder will reflect
the branch that you are working on within GitKraken (I'm in 'main' now, so this
is main/first_doc.txt, but if I switch to 'NewDev', the branch-specific txt files
will pop up in the folder instead of the 'main' files.)


Added this one in local repo, at the same spot as github line in "main"
